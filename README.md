# CS-360 Event Tracker App

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements for this app were to create an event tracking application which allowed users to login and store their credentials in a database, create, read, update, and delete events, and enable permissions to recieve SMS messages and notify users about upcoming events.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

There were a few screens that were necessary to support user needs. The first is the login screen which provides a layer of security within the application. Second, is the main event tracking screen which allows users to view, edit, update, and delete events. Third, is the SMS notification screen which allows users to enable SMS permissions to recieve notifications and send a test message to ensure that it is functioning properly.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

The biggest take away for me with this project was how important the initial design process is when building an app, or any software for that matter. For this project I did not really have a backup plan for my code design, and almost everything I had planned to implement in the beginning was not feasible by the deadline simply because I wasn't familiar with the limited functionality of the calendar view widget in android studio. This forced me to rethink the whole UI design and code for the main event tracking screen. In the future, I will take into consideration the tools that I have at hand and whether or not I am capable of using them how I intend to. Overall, successfully coding the app requires a lot of planning and foresight in the design phase, as well as being familiar with the limits of the tools you are using.

The approach I took for this project has not changed much from previous projects, the only difference is that I am getting better at adapting to new development environments, which will definitely be beneficial in future projects.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

For this project I made sure I understood the list of requirements, and planned out the UI for each screen to meet that criteria. Then as I am developing the application I constantly build the project and navigate through the UI, imagining that I am a user navigating through an app I just downloaded. This helps me to quickly identify what features need to be added or fixed to have a create a smooth user experience.

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Adding some of the features I wanted required a lot of research and experimentation. I learned quickly that if some implementation was not working correctly, and it was not absolutely necessary for the user experience, then I either needed to think of another approach or scrap that feature altogether. This happened frequently while using the calendar view widget, since it has limited functionality and customization options, I could not implement color-coded events to be displayed on my calendar. If I had been hung up on this issue, I would never have had the time to implement the more important features like the CRUD functionality for the event database.

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The component of this application that I think was most successful was the overall UI design, even though I did have to change it from my original design. I believe I was successful in creating a clean user experience and smooth navigation between all of the different screens. The buttons are clearly marked with icons which tell the user exactly how they will function.
